# Slazy - Slay your Health Goals lazy peeps 🎯

## 💡Inspiration
* 💻 Often, Computer Science students and working professionals spend most of their time sitting on the desk. The continuous period of physical inactivity required with a desk job poses a constant threat of chronic back, neck and arm pain, in addition to lethal conditions of congestive heart failure and stroke.

* 🚴‍♂️ Due to long stretches of work, we frequently neglect basic tasks required for sustenance, such as drinking ample amount of water, relaxing our eyes, and exercising enough.

* 🧘‍♀️ Meditation is a proven way to improve efficiency and reduce stress at work. Sadly, a lot less people have the adequate knowledge of performing it.

## 🔧 How we built it?

* __Website:__ HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* __Deployment:__ Github Pages
* __Tools:__ Git

## 🔴 Use of Github 🔴

We used github to collaborate and create this project in multiple ways:

* 1⃣ **Collaboration with Pull Requests:** We were a team of three members. Therefore, we created detailed **Pull Requests** to collaborate over this project. Moreover, all the bugs/features were dealt using **Issues**. We also requested **Reviews** on the PRs so that the changes could not break the product.

* 2⃣ **Collaboration with Project:** Recently, we came accross Github Projects. For this hack, we utilized Github Projects to keep a track of each one's progress. We created different sections: ToDo, In Progress, Under Review, Finished and Video for the perfect team collaboration. You can check our Project [here](https://github.com/users/savi-1311/projects/3). The complete process was automated and on attaching the Project to the PRs, they were transferred to the ToDo column.

* 3⃣ **Branch Usage:** Since we had two products, a chrome extension as well as a website, we initially thought of creating two repostories. But smartly using branches, helped us store our code without using two repos. The extension is stored on the ```master``` branch and the website is on the ```website``` branch. After using the branches, it was quite easy for us to create PRs.

* 4⃣ **Github Pages:** Our Website is deployed at https://savi-1311.github.io/Slazy/ using Github pages. It was very simple to set up and host the ```website``` branch.

* 5⃣ **Github Wiki:** We also utilized the Github Wiki to explain how to setup the project locally. You can check the wiki [here](https://github.com/savi-1311/Slazy/wiki/%F0%9F%94%A7-Setting-Up-the-Extension).

## Challenges We Ran Into 🙁

❗️Enabling multiple alarms: We had alarms/notofications at specific intervals of 20,45,30 and 90 mins. But all the alarms were going off at once. It was difficult to test them as a lot of patience was required to wait for alarms to trigger with time. Finally, with conditional statements and a lot of stackoverflow answers, we could get it solved.

❗Scrolling to different sections, adjusting the scroll button alignment and animation, and fixing content with the cards were tricky. But with some tweaks, we finally managed to cover those errors.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 😇

We could complete both the website and extension in the stipulated time. We had divided the work among ourselves. Time management played a crucial role in finishing this hack.

***

## What we learnt? 🤔

**Creating Notifications:** It was our first time building a notification system for the extension. It is indeed a great feature and over this weekend we understood how to use it.

**Creating PRs in Github:** For us, Pull Requests ususally meant forking and merging in the master branch. But, for the first time, we collaborated over a project and understood the importance of proper nomenclature of branches, PRs and Issues. It was important to have practices based on industry standards.

**Projects in Github:** For the first time, we used Projects in Github. It was initially new to set up but after we got the hang of it, collaboration an dividing tasks were super simple.

## What's next for Slazy?
* Custom Reminders
* Custom daily goals
* Backend system for users to put up their own blogs in the mind corner section.
