# Slazy - Slay your Health Goals lazy peeps 🎯

## 💡Inspiration
* 💻 Often, Computer Science students and working professionals spend most of their time sitting on the desk. The continuous sitting required with a desk job poses a constant threat of chronic back, neck and arm pain in addition to lethal conditions of congestive heart failure and stroke.

* 🚴‍♂️ Due to continous stretch of work, we often cannot complete basic tasks such as drinking ample amount of water, relaxing our eyes, and exersising enough. 

* 🧘‍♀️ Meditation is a proven way to improve efficiency and reduce stress at work. Still, a lot less people have knowledge to do it properly.

## Challenges We Ran Into 🙁

❗️Enabling multiple alarms: We had alarms/notofications at specific intervals of 20,45,30 and 90 mins. But all the alarms were going off at once. It was difficult to test them as a lot of patience was required to wait for alarms to trigger with time. Finally, with conditional statements and a lot of stackoverflow answers, we could get it solved.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of 😇

We could complete both the website and extension in the stipulated time. We had divided the work among ourselves. Time management played a crucial role in finishing this hack.

## What we learnt? 🤔

**Creating Notifications:** It was our first time building a notification system for the extension. It is indeed a great feature and over this weekend we understood how to use it.

**Creating PRs in Github:** For us, Pull Requests ususally meant forking and merging in the master branch. But, for the first time, we collaborated over a project and understood the importance of proper nomenclature of branches, PRs and Issues. It was important to have practices based on industry standards.

**Projects in Github:** For the first time, we used Projects in Github. It was initially new to set up but after we got the hang of it, collaboration an dividing tasks were super simple.
